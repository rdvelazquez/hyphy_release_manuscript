## Optimized for Larger Datasets

HyPhy has been optimized to analyze datasets with thousands of sequences and tens of thousands of sites. 
This optimization was accomplished by (1) integrating recent algorithmic advances from the fields of machine learning and natural language processing [@raw:LDA] into the core c++ implementation (2) incorporating fast Bayesian methods [@doi:10.1093/molbev/mst030] (3) developing parallel implementations for commute intensive processes and (4) providing high performance computing infrastructure[@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti320; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq429; @doi:10.1093/molbev/msx335] free of charge to the global community, helping to democratize access to scientific computing resources [@doi:10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2013.05.010].
