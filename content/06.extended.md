## Extended to Include a Broader Set of Standard Analyses

Although the HyPhy package provides for limitless customization via writing HBL scripts, users can run many common analyses without needing to concern themselves with the HBL at all. 
The HyPhy package comes with pre-written HBL scripts for easily performing some of the most commonly used analyses. 
These analyses can be executed in the various places HyPhy is available and include:  
  
+ __aBSREL__ [@doi:10.1093/molbev/msv022; @doi:10.1093/molbev/msr125] (adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood) - Detect positive/diversifying selection at individual branches  
+ __BGM__ [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btn313] (Bayesian Graphical Models) - Test for co-evolving sites  
+ __BUSTED__ [@doi:10.1093/molbev/msv035] (Branch-Site Unrestricted Statistical Test for Episodic Diversification) - Test gene-wide selection at pre-defined lineages
