HyPhy (Hypothesis testing using Phyloginies) is an open source software package for comparative sequence analysis using stochastic evolutionary models. 
Since itâ€™s initial release in 2005 [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti079] HyPhy has become an integral tool for the bioinformatics community with over 10,000 registered users, over 2,000 peer-reviewed citations and approximately 1,000 HyPhy jobs processed each week on the datamonkey web server [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti320; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq429; @doi:10.1093/molbev/msx335]. 
Extensions and improvements to the HyPhy package have been ongoing since its inception, with active feedback between users and developers producing new features tailored to the specific needs of the research community. 
Here we announce the release of the newest version of HyPhy (version 2.4.0) and document how the software has been (1) packaged for easy use in a variety of settings (2) optimized for larger datasets (3) redesigned to follow modern bioinformatics best practices and (4) extended to include common methods out of the box.
